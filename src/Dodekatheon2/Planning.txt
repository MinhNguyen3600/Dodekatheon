IMPORTANT! - Review if, based on what we're working on, if python or Java would be the best way to work on this game
WHY? - Java is OOP-centered, thus can be used to 


2. Weapons
- Weapon datasheets will be assigned as an "weapData" object class containing each of their datasheet stats, e.g.:
```
    public class weapData(string rng, str atks, str B_WS, int S, int AP, str D){
        this.rng = range;
        this.atks = attacks;
        this.B_WS = bal_WeapSkill;
        this.S = strength;
        this.AP = armorPen;
        this.D = damage;
    }

    weapData bolt_rifle = new weapData("24", 2, "3+", 4, -1, "1");
    weapData astartes_chainsword = new weapData("Melee", 5, "3+", 4, -1, "1")
```
- Weapon abilities will be defined as modifiers to either game conditions or weapons when they're used, for e.g.:
```
    public class weapAbilKey(str weapKey){
        switch (weapKey) {
            
        }
    }
    
```
    + NOTE: weapon ability keywords that are dependent on target unit information  will be added later on
