**Warhammer 40k - Dodekatheon**

WH40k Dodekatheon is a simple/minimalistic tabletop simulator for Warhammer 40k's tabletop boardgame. The goal of this is to create a 1 to 1 recreation of the actual game, including game phases, army/unit building, weapon and unit abilities, and more. This game aims to give new or even experienced tabletop players a chance to experience the tabletop game, without having to worry about Game's Workshop's expensive models, nor allocate space to play on. For experienced players, this game may serve more as a tool to test out strategies, win rates, different match ups between armies and to even test out unobtained units, characters or test codexes releases, balance updates, newly released models' datasheets, etc.

Please note that this game is not intended to replace the tabletop game itself, but merely imitate it to create a faster and simpler experience compared to the real game. If you are truly interested in the games themselves, I highly recommend you get some sets that you think is cool and try to play the real game yourself with some friends or with your local hobby store!

After the outbreak of the Horus Heresy, a simulation table featuring the Imperial Palace became a permanent feature of the Dodekatheon aboard the Iron Blood." - wh40k Lexicanum - Dokaethon (https://wh40k.lexicanum.com/wiki/Dodekatheon)
