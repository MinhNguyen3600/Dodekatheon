Alright, next, implement the shooting phase. Here's the text version of the core rules explaining it:

SHOOTING PHASE
Guns thunder and shrapnel flies through the air. Bursts of muzzle flare and beams of las-fire illuminate the fog of war, and spent ammunition cartridges litter the battlefield.

```
Use the following sequence when a unit shoots:
1 - SELECT ELIGIBLE UNIT
2 - SELECT TARGETS
3 - MAKE RANGED ATTACKS
4 - REPEAT FOR NEXT ELIGIBLE UNIT
```

Select Targets
Each time a unit shoots, before any attacks are resolved, you must select the enemy units that will be the targets for all of the ranged weapons you wish its models to make attacks with. Each time you select a target for a model’s ranged weapon, you can only select an enemy unit as the target if at least one model in that unit is both within range of that weapon and visible to that attacking model. An enemy model is within range of a weapon if the distance between it and the attacking model is equal to or less than that weapon’s Range characteristic.

If a model has more than one ranged weapon, it can shoot all of them at the same target or it can shoot each of them at a different target, but it cannot split attacks from the same weapon across more than one target. Similarly, if a unit has more than one model, those models can shoot at the same or different targets. In any case, when you select a target unit you must declare which models will target that unit with which weapons before any attacks are resolved. If any of these weapons have more than one profile that you must choose between, you must also declare which profile is being used.

In your Shooting phase, if you have one or more eligible units from your army on the battlefield, you can select those units, one at a time, and shoot with them. Each unit can only be selected to shoot once per phase. Once all of the units you selected have shot, progress to your Charge phase.

A unit is eligible to shoot unless any of the following apply:

    That unit Advanced this turn.
    That unit Fell Back this turn.


Unless at least one model in a unit has an eligible target for one or more of its ranged weapons, that model’s unit cannot be selected to shoot.

Designer’s Note: This doesn’t change the unit’s eligibility to shoot, but it does mean that a unit can’t be selected to shoot at nothing, and therefore won’t qualify for other rules triggers (e.g. GARGOYLES’ Winged Swarm ability and Dark Pacts)

```
 - Before a unit shoots, select the targets for all of its ranged weapons.
 - At least one model in the target unit must be visible to the attacking model and within range of the weapon being used.
 - Models with more than one ranged weapon can shoot them at the same or different targets, but models cannot split attacks from the same weapon across more than one target.
 - Models in the same unit can shoot at the same or different targets.
```

MAKE RANGED ATTACKS
The shooting unit’s models now make attacks using their ranged weapons. Each time a model shoots with a ranged weapon, it will make a number of attacks equal to the Attacks (A) characteristic in that weapon’s profile. You make one Hit roll for each attack being made (see Making Attacks).

If you selected more than one target for your unit to shoot at, you must resolve all of the attacks against one target before moving on to the next target. If your unit is shooting more than one ranged weapon at a target, and those weapons have different profiles, then after you have resolved attacks with one of those weapons you must, if any other weapons with the same profile are also being shot at that unit, resolve those attacks before resolving any other attacks against the target.

Note that, provided at least one model in the target unit was visible to an attacking model and in range of that attacking model’s weapon when that target unit was selected, that weapon’s attacks can still be made, even if no models in the target unit remain visible to or in range of it when you come to resolve those attacks (for example, because models in the target unit have already been destroyed by attacks made with other weapons in the attacking model’s unit).

Big Guns Never Tire
Monsters and war engines can dispense death from afar even as they trample the masses before them.
MONSTER and VEHICLE units are eligible to shoot in their controlling player’s Shooting phase even while they are within Engagement Range of one or more enemy units. Ranged weapons equipped by MONSTER and VEHICLE units can target one or more of the enemy units they are within Engagement Range of, even if other friendly units are also within Engagement Range of the same enemy unit. Each time a MONSTER or VEHICLE unit makes a ranged attack, if that unit was within Engagement Range of one or more enemy units when it selected its targets, unless that attack is made with a Pistol, subtract 1 from that attack’s Hit roll.

You can select an enemy MONSTER or VEHICLE unit within Engagement Range of one or more units from your army as a target of ranged weapons. Each time a model from your army makes a ranged attack against such a target, unless that attack is made with a Pistol, subtract 1 from that attack’s Hit roll.

Designer’s Note: A unit that is within Engagement Range of an enemy MONSTER or VEHICLE unit is still not eligible to shoot, and so cannot make ranged attacks against that MONSTER or VEHICLE unit (unless that unit is eligible to shoot even while within Engagement Range of enemy units, e.g. it is itself a MONSTER or VEHICLE unit, or its models are equipped with Pistols). Other units from your army that are eligible to shoot can, however, target and shoot that enemy MONSTER or VEHICLE unit.

 - MONSTERS and VEHICLES can shoot, and be shot at, even while they are within Engagement Range of enemy units. Each time a ranged attack is made by or against such a unit, subtract 1 from that attack’s Hit roll (unless shooting with a Pistol).
```

LOCKED IN COMBAT
A unit is not eligible to shoot while it is within Engagement Range of one or more enemy units.

While an enemy unit is within Engagement Range of one or more units from your army, you cannot select that enemy unit as a target of ranged weapons.

MONSTER and VEHICLE units are exceptions to these rules, as described in the Big Guns Never Tire section.

```
 - Units cannot shoot while within Engagement Range of enemy units.
 - Units cannot shoot at targets within Engagement Range of friendly units.
```

MAKING ATTACKS
Attacks are made using ranged or melee weapons. Attacks can be made one at a time or, in some cases, you can roll for multiple attacks together

```
Use the following sequence to make attacks one at a time.
1 - HIT ROLL
2 - WOUND ROLL
3 - ALLOCATE ATTACK
4 - SAVING THROW
5 - INFLICT DAMAGE
```

1. HIT ROLL
When a model makes an attack, make one Hit roll for that attack by rolling one D6. If the result of the Hit roll is greater than or equal to the attack’s Ballistic Skill (BS) characteristic (if the attack is being made with a ranged weapon) or its Weapon Skill (WS) characteristic (if the attack is being made with a melee weapon), then that Hit roll is successful and scores one hit against the target unit. Otherwise, the attack fails and the attack sequence ends.

An unmodified Hit roll of 6 is called a Critical Hit and is always successful. An unmodified Hit roll of 1 always fails. A Hit roll can never be modified by more than -1 or +1.

```
 - Hit Roll (Ranged Attack): A hit is scored if the D6 result equals or exceeds that attack’s BS.
 - Hit Roll (Melee Attack): A hit is scored if the D6 result equals or exceeds that attack’s WS.
 - Critical Hit: Unmodified Hit roll of 6. Always successful.
 - An unmodified Hit roll of 1 always fails.
 - A Hit roll can never be modified by more than -1 or +1.
```

2. WOUND ROLL
Each time an attack scores a hit against a target unit, make a Wound roll for that attack by rolling one D6 to see if that attack successfully wounds the target unit. The result required is determined by comparing the attack’s Strength (S) characteristic with the target’s Toughness (T) characteristic, as shown below.

```
WOUND ROLL
ATTACK’S STRENGTH VS TARGET’S TOUGHNESS | D6 RESULT REQUIRED
Strength is TWICE (or more than twice) the Toughness. | 2+
Strength is GREATER than the Toughness. | 3+
Strength is EQUAL to the Toughness. | 4+
Strength is LESS than the Toughness. | 5+
Strength is HALF (or less than half) the Toughness. | 6+
```

If the result of the Wound roll is greater than or equal to the required number shown in the table above, then that Wound roll is successful and scores one wound against the target unit. Otherwise, the attack fails and the attack sequence ends.

An unmodified Wound roll of 6 is called a Critical Wound and is always successful. An unmodified Wound roll of 1 always fails. A Wound roll can never be modified by more than -1 or +1.

```
 - Critical Wound: Unmodified Wound roll of 6. Always successful.
 - An unmodified Wound roll of 1 always fails.
 - A Wound roll can never be modified by more than -1 or +1.
```

3. ALLOCATE ATTACK
If an attack successfully wounds the target unit, the player controlling the target unit allocates that attack to one model in the target unit, as follows.

If a model in the target unit has already lost one or more wounds, or has already had attacks allocated to it this phase, that attack must be allocated to that model. Otherwise, that attack can be allocated to any model in the target unit. Note that it does not matter if that model is visible to or within range/Engagement Range of the attacking model.

```
- If a model in the target unit has already lost any wounds or had other attacks allocated to it this phase, the attack must be allocated to that model.
```

4. SAVING THROW	
The player controlling the target unit then makes one saving throw. By default, this will be an armour saving throw using their model’s Save (Sv) characteristic, but some models have invulnerable saves that can be used instead (see below). To make an armour saving throw, roll one D6, then modify the result by the Armour Penetration (AP) characteristic of the attack. For example, if the attack has an AP of -1, then 1 is subtracted from the saving throw.

If the result is greater than or equal to the Save characteristic of the model the attack was allocated to, then that saving throw is successful and the attack sequence ends. Otherwise, that saving throw fails and that model suffers damage.

An unmodified saving throw of 1 always fails. A saving throw can never be improved by more than +1.

```
 - Saving Throw: Roll one D6 and modify by the attack’s AP. If the result is less than the Save of the model being rolled for, the saving throw is failed and that model suffers damage. Otherwise, that attack is saved.
 - An unmodified saving throw of 1 always fails.
 - A saving throw can never be improved by more than +1.
```

```
Invulnerable Saves

Whether shielded by force fields, enveloped in mystical energies or simply possessed of preternatural senses and lightning-fast reflexes, some warriors are protected by more than mere physical armour.
Some models have an invulnerable save listed on their datasheet. Each time an attack is allocated to a model with an invulnerable save, the controlling player must choose to use either that model’s Save characteristic or its invulnerable save, but not both. If a model has more than one invulnerable save, it can only use one of them – choose which it will use.

Unlike armour saving throws (which use a model’s Save characteristic), invulnerable saving throws are never modified by an attack’s Armour Penetration characteristic, but otherwise follow the normal rules for saving throws.

 - Invulnerable Save: Never modified by an attack’s AP.
 - The controlling player can choose to use either a model’s invulnerable save or its Save characteristic.
```

```
MORTAL WOUNDS

Some attacks are so powerful that no armour or force field can withstand their fury.
Some rules inflict mortal wounds on units. Each time mortal wounds are inflicted on a unit, each of those mortal wounds inflicts one point of damage to that unit, and they are always applied one at a time. Each mortal wound is allocated to a model in the same manner as allocating an attack. Excess damage from mortal wounds is not lost if the damage can be allocated to another model. Instead, keep allocating damage to another model in the target unit until either all the damage has been allocated or the target unit is destroyed.

If an attack inflicts mortal wounds in addition to any normal damage, do not make a Wound roll or saving throw (including invulnerable saving throws) against those mortal wounds. If those mortal wounds are inflicted by an attack that has the [PRECISION] ability, the attacking model’s controlling player can allocate those mortal wounds to a CHARACTER model in that unit.

If mortal wounds are being inflicted as a result of the [HAZARDOUS] ability or by an attack with the [DEVASTATING WOUNDS] ability that scored a Critical Wound, each time those mortal wounds are allocated to a model, if that model is destroyed as a result of those mortal wounds, the remaining mortal wounds from that attack are lost, just as with a normal attack.

If, when a unit is selected to shoot or fight, one or more of its attacks can inflict mortal wounds on the target, resolve any normal damage inflicted by the attacking unit’s attacks on that target before inflicting any mortal wounds on that target. If an attack inflicts mortal wounds in addition to any normal damage, but the normal damage is subsequently saved, the target unit still suffers those mortal wounds, as described above.

 - Each mortal wound inflicted on a unit causes one model in that unit to lose one wound.
 - Unless the source of the mortal wounds is the [HAZARDOUS] ability or an attack with the [DEVASTATING WOUNDS] ability, damage from mortal wounds is not lost if it can be allocated to another model.
 - No saving throws can be made against mortal wounds.
 - Mortal wounds inflicted by attacks always apply after any normal damage, even if that damage was saved.
```

5. INFLICT DAMAGE
The damage inflicted is equal to the Damage (D) characteristic of the attack. A model loses one wound for each point of damage it suffers. If a model’s wounds are reduced to 0 or less, it is destroyed and removed from play. If a model loses several wounds from an attack and is destroyed, any excess damage inflicted by that attack is lost and has no effect.

```
 - A model loses a number of wounds equal to the attack’s Damage characteristic.
 - If a model is destroyed by an attack, any excess damage inflicted by that attack is lost.
```
