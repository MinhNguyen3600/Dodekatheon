Dodekatheon To-dos:

1. check an error in unit_builder.py where in the 5) while true loop, the subfaction is used but outside of the subfaction coniditon, so when only a primary faction is chosen, this error shows up:
```
\unit_builder.py", line 116, in build_army
    if subfaction and len(facs)>1 and facs[1]==subfaction
       ^^^^^^^^^^
UnboundLocalError: cannot access local variable 'subfaction' where it is not associated with a value
``` 
This is because subfaction condition wasn't gone through, leading to undefined subfaction, thus the units cannot be displayed

2. Check specifically in shooting and fight phase is there are any weapon ability function names need to be updated (just updated their definitions inside weappon_ability.py, best check if anything needs updating to mitigate future errors)
