I won't be implementing aura for these selective unit abilities yet, instead, I want to focus more on an army. Each army/faction has their own specific rules, detatchments, stratagems, and more. We may have to create a new sub-folder inside "data" in order to store python files for each army available. Please keep in mind that this is an extremely large update, so we'll have to do a step-by-step implementation.
